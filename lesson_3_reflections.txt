When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would use a remote repository rather than only a local one if you were collaborating
on your project with other people or if you wanted others to be able to access and contribute
to your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to pull changes manually if you don't want the work that another contributor
has done to affect a certain feature you are working on. You may want to work on your part
alone first before seeing if it works with other people's work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
 of another?

You would use a fork when you want to copy someone's respository to your own GitHub account.
You would use clone when you want to copy a repository from GitHub to your machine or when
you want to copy a repository on your machine to another location on the machine.
You would use a branch when you want to work on a new feature or experiment with your project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This is beneficial because it lets you know what the latest changes on the remote were before
you start working.
