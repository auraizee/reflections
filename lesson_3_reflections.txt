When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would use a remote repository rather than only a local one if you were collaborating
on your project with other people or if you wanted others to be able to access and contribute
to your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to pull changes manually if you don't want the work that another contributor
has done to affect a certain feature you are working on. You may want to work on your part
alone first before seeing if it works with other people's work.
